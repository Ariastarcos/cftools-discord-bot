## ‚≠ê It's free, open-source, and self-host - meaning you're in full control

This project was created and open-sourced by [Mirasaki Development](https://mirasaki.dev). That means it's publicly available for anyone to grab and do whatever with (MIT licensed). This project will never be monetized, every feature will always be free (keep in mind CFTools has premium endpoints). All I need to keep adding new functionality and modules is some GitHub stars. Join the absolute **legends** below by clicking that Star button in the top-right of your screen, it doesn't cost you anything **and** means the world to us ‚ù§Ô∏è

<br/>
<h2 id="discord-permissions">üü£ Discord Permissions</h2>

> This is not the permission level required to execute actions or run commands, like User, Moderator or Administrator

Invite the bot to your server by navigating to the following URL (replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with `CLIENT_ID` from the `/config/.env` file):

`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands`

Any command can be used without any Discord permissions, as long as the bot is invited to your server with the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes. You can use the template url above, or alternatively, generate an invite link in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) (Your App > OAuth2 > URL Generator > `scopes: bot + applications.commands`)

`AUTOMATIC_LEADERBOARD_MODULE`: This requires the following permissions in any channel this module is assigned to: `View Channel`, `Read Message History`, `Send Messages`, and `Embed Links`

`DISCORD_TO_DAYZ_LIVE_CHAT_RELAY`: This module requires the privileged Discord "Message Content Intent" (Your App > Bot > Enable `Message Content Intent`). This module also required the following permissions in the channel where Discord messages are relayed from: `View Channel` and `Read Message History`

<br/>
<h2 id="client-permissions">üü¢ Client Permissions</h2>

These are permission levels that are used internally by the bot to determine the permission level of any given user and determine which commands they can use. Available permissions levels are:

> *You can modify Moderators, Administrators, Developers and Bot Owners in `/config/config.js`, this is optional*

- 0 - User - This is the default permission levels, everyone has this this - doesn't have access to any dangerous commands
- 1 - Moderator - The moderator permission level has access to moderation commands like `/heal`, `/kick`, and `/ban` in the future. Anyone that has the Discord permissions `Kick Members` and `Ban Members`, or has a role that is defined in the `config#permissions#moderatorRoleIds` is considered a Moderator
- 2 - Administrator - The Administrator permission level is the highest permission level that can be assigned through Discord. Anyone with the Discord permission `Administrator`, or has a role that is defined in the `config#permissions#administratorRoleIds` is considered an Administrator internally and will have access to dangerous/sensitive commands like `/broadcast`, `/dm-survivor`, and `/spawn-item`
- 3 - Server Owner - This is the permission level of your Discord server owner, only 1 person can have this at any given time. Used to make sure server owners have a snowflake permission level internally üôè Doesn't currently have any exclusive commands, but you can choose to restrict commands to this permission level as needed
- 4 - Developer - This is for members that develop on the bot, has access to dev utilities like `/eval` and `/exec`. This permission level can do almost everything, including evaluating arbitrary code on your host machine - use with caution!
- 5 - Bot Owner - Bypasses every permission bit and level check, has access to every command and command.

You can modify required permission levels to execute commands in the command files by setting the permLevel property. Let's take a look at an example `/src/commands/` file:

```javascript
module.exports = new ChatInputCommand({
  // Inside of the ChatInputCommand({
  // Can be set to User, Moderator, Administrator, Server Owner, Developer, Bot Owner
  // Support IntelliSense/auto-complete
  permLevel: 'Administrator',
  // ... other properties
  run: async (client, interaction) => {
    // The commands #run/execute function
  }
});
```

<br/>
<h2 id="server-configuration">üõ†Ô∏è Server Configuration</h2>

All server configuration is done in `config/servers.js`. Multiple servers are supported. The server configuration file is created during the installation and usage steps. Below is detailed information on what the settings do.

```js

To add a second, or more, servers - copy-paste your entire server block and modify the configuration. Afterwards, make sure your syntax is still valid:

```javascript
[
  {
    ...
  }, <-- Notice the comma - always add this when adding a new server block
  {
    ...
  }
]
```

<h2 id="installation-and-usage">üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage</h2>

### Prerequisites

- A CFTools [developer application](https://developer.cftools.cloud/applications)
  - Make sure you navigate to the "Grant URL" that's displayed and authorize access to your server & resources (ban lists for example)
- A [Discord Bot account](https://discord.com/developers/applications "Discord Developer Portal")
    1) Head over to the page linked above
    2) Click "New Application" in the top right
    3) Give it a cool name and click "Create"
    4) Click "Bot" in the left hand panel
    5) Click "Add Bot" -> "Yes, do it!"
    6) Click "Reset Token" and copy it to your clipboard, you will need it later
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Node official website") (if you're running as a plain NodeJS app)
    1) Head over to the download page
    2) Download the latest LTS build available for your OS
    3) Be sure to check the box that says "Automatically install the necessary tools" when you're running the installation wizard
- [Chromium Browser](https://www.chromium.org/Home/), if you want to use `/statistics` hit-zone heat-maps (can be disabled)
  - Comes with most Windows installations, if not - [download](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium/) the application
  - `sudo apt-get install chromium-browser` for most Linux distributions, or use your distro's apt-alternative (package manager) - if this doesn't work you might have to point `puppeteer` to your browser executable
  - `brew install chromium && which chromium` on Mac OS

### Run as a Docker container (preferred)

The quickest and easiest way to host/use this bot is by deploying it inside of a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ "Official Docker Website") container.

> *A [**docker-compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/ "View docker-compose documentation") file is included for your convenience*

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Mirasaki/cftools-discord-bot.git`
2. Navigate inside the new folder: `cd cftools-discord-bot`
3. Rename `/config/.env.example` to `.env` and provide your environmental variables
    - Windows users often experience issues with this file, if you're getting errors that the env file can't be found, or `Expected path argument to be of type string` - check out [this timestamped video](https://youtu.be/6rOCUZ8opLM?t=42)
4. Rename `/config/config.example.js` to `config.js` and provide your bot configuration
5. Rename `/config/servers.example.js` to `servers.js` and provide your server configuration
    - Alternatively, you can now use the `docker-compose up` command to finish setting up the project if you have the [Docker Compose CLI](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed
6. Build the project: `docker build --tag my-cftools-discord-bot .`
7. Start the bot: `docker run -it --env-file .env --name my-cftools-discord-bot`

### Run as a plain NodeJS app

You can also clone this repository or download a release, and host the project directly. You will need [Node/NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node official website") (Be sure to check the box that says "Automatically install the necessary tools" when you're running the installation wizard)

1. Head over to [the download page](https://github.com/Mirasaki/cftools-discord-bot/releases/)
    - Alternatively, clone this repository by using `git clone https://github.com/Mirasaki/cftools-discord-bot.git` and skip to step 4 if you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Git Download Section") installed
2. Download either the `zip` or `zip.gz` source code
3. Extract it using [your favorite zip tool](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm "It's WinRar, duh")
4. Open a new console/terminal/shell window in the newly created project folder
5. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
6. Rename [`/config/.env.example`](/config/.env.example "View .env.example file in current repository") to `.env` and configure your environmental variables
7. Rename [`/config/config.example.js`](/config/config.example.js "View config.example.js file in current repository") to `config.js` and go through your bot configuration
8. Rename [`/config/servers.example.js`](/config/servers.example.js "View servers.example.js file in current repository") to `servers.js` and go through your server configuration
9. Use the command `node .` to start the application, or alternatively:
    - `npm run start` to keep the process alive with [PM2](https://pm2.io/ "PM2 | Official Website"), suitable for production environments. (`npm i -g pm2` to install)
    - `npm run start:dev` if you have `nodemon` installed for automatic restarts on changes, suitable for development environments
